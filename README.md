# Causal-Inference-Project
This repository contains the final project for STAT 156: Causal Inference at UC Berkeley, taught by Professor Amanda Coston.

In this project, we replicated the findings of a study on the effects of air quality regulations in the United States, applying causal inference methods such as Difference-in-Differences (DiD), Regression Discontinuity (RD), and Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW).

This work was completed in collaboration with Jaeeun Park and Yixin Feng.
